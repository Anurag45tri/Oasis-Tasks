        <h2>About Steve Jobs</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Steve Jobs, a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of Apple Inc., revolutionized the technology industry with his emphasis on design, simplicity, and innovation. Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, introducing groundbreaking products like the Macintosh computer, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. His departure from and subsequent return to Apple marked a pivotal moment in the company's history, leading to a revitalization of its product line and a resurgence in profitability. Beyond Apple, Jobs played a significant role in the success of Pixar Animation Studios, contributing to hit films like "Toy Story" and "Finding Nemo." Despite battling pancreatic cancer, Jobs remained deeply involved in product development until his passing on October 5, 2011, leaving behind a lasting 
            legacy as one of the most influential figures of the digital age.</p>
